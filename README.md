**Hello, this is OMU-BOT 
OMU-BOT is a question answering chatbot for Ondokuz Mayıs Üniversity. It is aimed to develop a chatbot that can answer the questions of Ondokuz Mayıs University students. Questions about the university, which are necessary for training the chatbot, were collected from students with a survey. The collected questions were aimed to be tokenized using the pre-trained Turkish bert model together with their answers. For a better tokenization process, a new token dictionary was created with a dataset containing Turkish words and added to the existing dictionary so that the model can better understand Turkish expressions. BERT for Sequence Classification is an effective and powerful BERT model used in text classification tasks. The text given as input to this model is divided into pieces with the WordPiece tokenization method. Some special tokens are added to these texts. Each token is represented by a pre-trained vector. Positional information is added to indicate the positions of the tokens in the text. The input text is processed through BERT’s multilayer Transformer encoders. These layers include self-attention and feedforward neural networks.
